Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a new student at 42 Madrid, and my journey has been quite an artistic adventure. Throughout my life, I've been dedicated to digital photography, painting, and the exploration of multimedia content creation, including music composition.
Early Days in Web Development

My foray into programming dates back to the late '90s, a time when I was already building web pages using HTML and later specializing in Flash. Unfortunately, the Flash technology I was immersing myself in fell out of favor, leading me to focus my efforts on photography and painting.
Rediscovering the Web

I found my way back to the web through WordPress, but today, I'm eager to take on a new challenge. My goal is to become a seasoned professional in the development of virtual and augmented reality applications.
Embracing the Dream

Throughout my life, I've harbored a dream that the technology behind virtual and augmented reality would become a reality. Now, I'm excited to acquire the skills needed to bring this dream to life by creating compelling and immersive content.
Current Focus

My current focus is on learning and mastering the skills necessary to be proficient in virtual and augmented reality development. I believe that by combining my artistic background with technical expertise, I can contribute to the exciting field of immersive technology.
GitHub Goals

I've joined GitHub to showcase my journey, share my projects, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I'm looking forward to learning from the vibrant GitHub community and contributing to the world of immersive experiences.

Let's connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
